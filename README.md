# Password-Generator

## Objective
The objective of this homework was to make a working random password generator. To accomplish this, I had to create the code for a function that promted the user on how long they wanted the password to be and if they wanted any special character, numbers, lowercase letter, and/or uppercase letters.

## Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge I faced while working on this was getting the possible pool of characters to include all of the user choices from the prompts. The solution to this was to create an object that held all of the values for each of the choices. Then once that was complete, I created several if statements that would add the values to the possible pool of characters based on the prompt choices.
